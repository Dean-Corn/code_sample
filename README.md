# SandBox
In the SandBox exercise, you'll be using the Elixir language to interact with the [Box](https://www.box.com) API.  The scaffolding you're given will create and destroy a file for you to create and delete comments against.

# Objectives

1) Fork this repository

2) Signup for a Box developer account

3) Authenticate to the Box API

4) Make sure all tests under test/integration/ are passing and add any new tests you feel are important

5) Create a pull request and give us a heads up.

# Learning Resources
Elixir is a functional language which lives on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine, just as Groovy or Clojure live on top of the Java Virtual Machine.  We at Pet Partners are functional programming enthusiest and have chosen to write all new software in Elixir wherever possible.  We recognize that functional programming requires a much different mindset and may not be for everyone.  Because of this, we've developed this simple programming assignment to determine if a potential candidate is a good match.
